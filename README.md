# Salaries over Time in Major League Baseball
# Introduction
Since the publication of Michael Lewis’s Moneyball in 2003, there has been an explosion in
interest in the field of sabermetrics, the application of empirical methods to baseball statistics.
Teams looking for an edge have increasingly turned to analysis of all manner of player statistics,
from the easy to understand home runs, to the exceedingly complex, such as weighted runs
created and fielding independent pitching. The main goal of these efforts have been to identify
players with high performance potential who may have flown under the radar and thus will not
command as astronomical of a salary as more well-known names. For this analysis, I performed
my own introductory sabermetrical excursion into the world of baseball statistics, although I
stuck to more familiar baseball metrics for hitting and pitching such as Runs Batted In (RBI) and
Earned Run Average (ERA) and the Average (AVG). I will discuss the following question in this
analysis.



# Question 1.: 
How has the average and the median salary of an MLB player changed
over time?
# Questions 2-7:
What is the relationship between some key batting stats and salary?
- I will see if there is a relationship between salary and:
- Batting Average (BA)
- On-base percentage (OBP)
- Home Runs (HR)
- Slugging percentage (SLG)
- Runs Scored (R)
- On-base plus slugging (OPS)
- Runs Batted In (RBI)***

# Datasets
I have download a dataset from ​ https://data.world/natereed/baseball-salaries and secondly, I got
the batting and pitching statistics from the ​ https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/MLB/​ .
